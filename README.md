I hope you are well. 

The first step of our hiring process is a small challenge. 

We will judge by the criteria: Code maintenance, readability, separation of responsibilities and expressiveness of names.

The game.rb file is the classic tic-tac-toe. However, the code is a mess and there are several issues that can be improved such as:
 - The handling of invalid entries is bad;
 - Lack of interactive messages with players.

We would also like to add some new features like:
 - Allow the player to choose the level of difficulty, today it is always on hard;
 - Allow the choice of different game types (human vs. human, computer vs. computer and human vs. computer) to be possible.

Can you help us finish the game?

Important:
 - You will have 7 days to do as much as you can. We know that time is short and very difficult to do everything. But do as much as you can;
 - After completion send us your Github repository link.

Thank you and good luck!

Regards, Raphael
